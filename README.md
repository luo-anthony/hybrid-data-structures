## Overview 

This library will contain various hybrid data structures such as the folllowing:
 - **Consistent Hash Ring with Bounded Loads**, based on [this paper from Google Research](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/consistent-hashing-with-bounded-loads.html)
 - **Hybrid HashSet / HashMap (maybe)**, loosely inspired by [LLVM's high-performance hybrid data structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vElZc6zSIXM&list=PLiDK46vnsTT-JerJ8k5-W5L-yKvSu0M41&index=3)
 - **Various Cache Structures (maybe)**, such as LRU/LFU cache
